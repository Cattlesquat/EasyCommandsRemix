  "Title": "Easy Commands (Remix for 1.0+)",
  "Description": "Tired of trawling through your inventory every time you need to switch grenades, pop a tonic, clean your items with water, or quench a fire? Easy Commands adds shortcut commands for applying tonics, changing your equipped grenade, accessing water containers, cleaning your items, or pouring water on yourself.\\n\\nTo use, visit Key Mappings after installing the mod and bind keys for the new options in the Easy section. I'm partial to H (heal) for tonics, Shift+T for grenades, Shift+C for cleaning, Shift+Q to quench fire, and Shift+W for water containers (rebinding the wish menu to something else), but you do you!\n\nWorks fine with existing saves.\n\n1.1 version removes the former recoiler option, because the Recoil ability can now be bound directly to a key in the base game - just go to the Abilities menu once you own at least one recoiler, and you can assign it a key.\n\n(For this mod I have repaired the breakages in Bad Mojo's original mod and made it work for Caves of Qud 1.0)\\n\\nhttps://github.com/Cattlesquat/EasyCommandsRemix.git",
